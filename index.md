## Welcome to Know ME!

### Let me introduce myself

My name is Vivek Tiwari, a graduate in Computer Science specialized in Intelligent Robotics from University of Southern California in May 2020. I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering back in India and since my final semester have been continuously involved in banging the doors of industry as an entrepreneur/explorer. I've been employed by Startups and research institutions in India and the USA. I've been part of some successful projects in designated markets covering domains like blockchains and artificial intelligence ( i.e. computer vision to be precise). I am great at working with people and I don't really have to say that; people in my professional circle can vouch for that. But owing to my versatility, I've been trusted with leading teams and client interactions for progress of projects and business development.

That's enough about me. I'll keep updating it as and when I think I can add to it to better introduce myself.

### Books I've read

I am an avid reader of self-help books. Let me tread very carefully here. I'm an avid reader of self-help books from authors who have actually developed something, not people who just had success because of only their book or speaking or stupidly motivation stuff, or just by writing about how other people made money.
